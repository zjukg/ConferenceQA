They are also allowed to give talks to restricted audiences on the work(s) submitted to ICML during the review. If you have posted or plan to post a non-anonymized version of your paper online before the ICML decisions are made, the submitted version must not refer to the non-anonymized version.ICML strongly discourages advertising the preprint on social media or in the press while under submission to ICML. Under no circumstances should your work be explicitly identified as ICML submission at any time during the review period, i.e., from the time you submit the paper to the communication of the accept/reject decisions.",

            "answer": "The goal of the workshops is to provide an informal forum for researchers to discuss emerging research questions and challenges. Workshops will last for one day, with morning and afternoon sessions and free time between the sessions for individual exchange. To encourage workshop variety, all workshops will be one-day workshops.The workshops can be on any subject relevant to a significant fraction of the ICML community. Schedules may encourage lively debates, and topics should lean more towards exploring new ideas, open problems, and interdisciplinary areas compared to the main conference. Workshops should encourage contributed content and reserve a significant portion of time for open/panel discussions and posters. A diverse group of speakers is more likely to bring diverse and surprising viewpoints on a topic. As a result, we encourage workshop organizers to be cognizant of designing panels and speaker lists that are inclusive.",
